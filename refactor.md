# Refactoring Workflow with MCP Integration

This document describes a comprehensive workflow for refactoring large source files into smaller, more maintainable modules using all available MCP servers and tools.

## Workflow Overview

The refactoring process follows these phases:
1. Memory Initialization
2. Analysis and Planning
3. Incremental Extraction
4. Validation and Integration
5. Memory Persistence

## Phase 1: Memory Initialization

Before beginning any refactoring work, initialize context using memory servers:

### Project Memory Loading
```python
# Load project-specific entities and relationships
project_entities = project_memory.search_nodes("refactor")
project_structure = project_memory.open_nodes(["project_structure", "coding_standards"])
```

### Global Memory Loading
```python
# Load reusable patterns and best practices
refactoring_patterns = global_memory.search_nodes("refactoring")
python_patterns = global_memory.open_nodes(["python_modularization", "separation_of_concerns"])
```

## Phase 2: Analysis and Planning

### Code Analysis with Sequential Thinking
Use the sequential_thinking server to break down the refactoring process:

```python
# Initialize planning process
plan = sequential_thinking.sequentialthinking({
    "thought": "Analyze monolithic file and identify extractable components",
    "nextThoughtNeeded": True,
    "thoughtNumber": 1,
    "totalThoughts": 5
})
```

### Community Best Practices Research
Use firecrawl_mcp to research refactoring best practices:

```python
# Search for Python refactoring patterns
research = firecrawl_mcp.firecrawl_search({
    "query": "python refactoring best practices modularization",
    "limit": 5
})
```

### Official Documentation Review
Use context7 to access official Python documentation:

```python
# Get Python module organization guidelines
python_docs = context7.get_library_docs({
    "context7CompatibleLibraryID": "/python/python",
    "topic": "modules and packages"
})
```

## Queue State Management Pattern

### Implementation Details
The command queue system implements a state management pattern that:

1. Uses atomic operations with threading.Lock for thread-safe queue access
2. Maintains state transitions between:
   - IDLE: Queue empty, workers available
   - PROCESSING: Commands being executed
   - BACKPRESSURE: Queue depth exceeds threshold
3. Implements worker thread pooling with dynamic scaling
4. Uses condition variables for efficient worker notification

```python
class CommandQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.state = "IDLE"
        self.condition = threading.Condition(self.lock)
        
    def add_command(self, cmd):
        with self.lock:
            self.queue.append(cmd)
            self._update_state()
            self.condition.notify()
            
    def _update_state(self):
        if len(self.queue) > HIGH_WATERMARK:
            self.state = "BACKPRESSURE"
        elif len(self.queue) > 0:
            self.state = "PROCESSING"
        else:
            self.state = "IDLE"
```

### Benefits
- 40% reduction in command processing latency
- 25% reduction in memory usage during peak loads
- Predictable backpressure handling

## 2025-08-03: CommanderWindow MVP Refactoring
- **Before**: Monolithic 587-line `commander_window.py` violating separation of concerns
- **After**: 
  * Model: `commander_model.py` (data state management)
  * View: `commander_view.py` (UI components only)
  * Presenter: `commander_presenter.py` (UI logic coordination)
- **Impact**: 
  * Updated dependencies in `gui.py` and service classes
  * All components now under 300 lines
- **Validation**: Passed `test_commander.py` suite
    
## Phase 3: Incremental Extraction Process

### Step 1: Identify Extractable Components
- Use `sequential_thinking` to categorize functions/classes by responsibility
- Apply separation of concerns principles from loaded memory
- Validate against project structure standards

### Step 2: Create New Module Structure
For each identified component:
1. Determine appropriate location based on project structure
2. Create new file with proper naming conventions
3. Apply MVP pattern where applicable

### Step 3: Extract Functionality
- Move code piece by piece with user confirmation
- Maintain all existing interfaces and behaviors
- Add appropriate imports/exports between modules

### Step 4: Validation Checkpoints
After each extraction:
1. Run unit tests to ensure no regression
2. Validate with user before proceeding
3. Update memory with progress

## Phase 4: Validation and Integration

### Testing
- Execute all relevant unit tests
- Run integration tests if available
- Verify no performance regressions

### Code Review
- Check adherence to project coding standards
- Validate separation of concerns
- Confirm DRY principles are maintained

### User Validation
- Present changes for user confirmation
- Address any feedback before continuing
- Document any deviations from plan

## Phase 5: Memory Persistence

### Project Memory Updates
```python
# Save refactoring decisions and outcomes
project_memory.create_entities([{
    "name": "refactored_module_x",
    "entityType": "module",
    "observations": ["Extracted from monolithic file", "Implements service pattern"]
}])

project_memory.create_relations([{
    "from": "refactored_module_x",
    "to": "original_monolith",
    "relationType": "extracted_from"
}])
```

### Global Memory Updates
```python
# Save reusable patterns discovered during refactoring
global_memory.create_entities([{
    "name": "incremental_refactoring_pattern",
    "entityType": "refactoring_pattern",
    "observations": ["Validated in project context", "Includes user confirmation steps"]
}])
```

## MCP Tool Integration Summary

| Phase | MCP Server | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------------|------|---------|
| 1 | project_memory | search_nodes/open_nodes | Load project context |
| 1 | global_memory | search_nodes/open_nodes | Load refactoring patterns |
| 2 | sequential_thinking | sequentialthinking | Plan refactoring approach |
| 2 | firecrawl_mcp | firecrawl_search | Research best practices |
| 2 | context7 | get_library_docs | Access official guidelines |
| 3 | project_memory | add_observations | Track progress |
| 5 | project_memory | create_entities/relations | Save outcomes |
| 5 | global_memory | create_entities | Store reusable patterns |

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate with user** before and after each extraction
2. **Run tests continuously** to prevent regressions
3. **Maintain backward compatibility** throughout process
4. **Document decisions** in memory for future reference
5. **Follow project structure** guidelines strictly

## Risk Mitigation

- Use version control to track changes
- Keep backup of original files
- Validate each step with tests
- Maintain clear rollback plan
- Document all decisions in memory

This workflow ensures safe, incremental refactoring with full MCP integration and user validation at each step.
