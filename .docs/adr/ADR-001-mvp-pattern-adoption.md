# ADR-001: MVP Pattern Adoption

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The CommanderWindow module in the LOGReporter application was originally implemented with tight coupling between UI components and business logic. This made the code difficult to maintain, test, and extend. To address these issues, we decided to refactor the module to follow the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern.

## Decision
We will adopt the MVP pattern for UI modules in the Commander component of the LOGReporter application. This pattern separates concerns into three distinct components:

1. **Model**: Handles data state and business logic
2. **View**: Manages the presentation layer and user interface elements
3. **Presenter**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling UI logic

## Rationale
The MVP pattern was selected for the following reasons:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between UI components and business logic makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

2. **Testability**: With separated concerns, each component can be unit tested independently, improving code quality and reducing bugs.

3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts since they are not tightly coupled to specific UI implementations.

4. **Maintainability**: Changes to the UI or business logic can be made with minimal impact on other components.

5. **Consistency with Project Standards**: The MVP pattern aligns with the project's coding standards defined in structure_global.md.

## Comparison with Alternative Patterns

### MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- **Pros**: Well-established pattern with clear separation of concerns
- **Cons**: Controllers can become bloated with logic, and the pattern doesn't translate well to desktop UI frameworks like PyQt

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Pros**: Excellent data binding capabilities, reduces boilerplate code
- **Cons**: PyQt doesn't have native data binding support, making implementation more complex and less intuitive

### MVP (Selected)
- **Pros**: Well-suited for desktop UI frameworks, clear separation of concerns, easy to test, presenter contains UI logic without direct UI dependencies
- **Cons**: Slight increase in code verbosity compared to MVVM, requires careful management of view-presenter communication

## Implementation Constraints and Decisions

### View Responsibilities
- Handle UI rendering and user input events
- Contain no business logic
- Communicate with the Presenter through well-defined interfaces
- Be stateless where possible

### Presenter Responsibilities
- Encapsulate UI logic
- Act as an intermediary between View and Model
- Contain no direct DOM or UI code
- Handle user interactions and update the Model accordingly
- Update the View based on Model changes

### Model Responsibilities
- Manage data state
- Contain business logic
- Be independent of UI concerns
- Provide data to the Presenter as needed

### Communication Patterns
- View to Presenter: Signal-based communication (PyQt signals)
- Presenter to View: Method calls on view interfaces
- Presenter to Model: Direct method calls
- Model to Presenter: Callbacks or signals for data updates

### File Structure
- Views will be placed in `src/commander/ui/`
- Presenters will be placed in `src/commander/presenters/`
- Models will remain in `src/commander/` or be moved to `src/commander/models/` as needed

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Better testability of UI components
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### Negative
- Initial refactoring effort required
- Slight increase in code verbosity
- Need for additional interfaces between components
