# LogWriter Configuration Guide

## Recent Enhancements
- Added OutputDestination enum for clear output handling:
  ```python
  class OutputDestination(Enum):
      TERMINAL = 1
      FILE = 2
      BOTH = 3
  ```
- Implemented configurable logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Improved file writing performance and reliability

## Configuration Options
```python
# Example configuration
writer = LogWriter(
    destination=OutputDestination.BOTH,
    log_level=LogLevel.INFO,
    file_path='output.log'
)
```

## Debugging Strategy
1. Set log_level to DEBUG for detailed troubleshooting
2. Use OutputDestination.TERMINAL for real-time monitoring
3. Review log files for historical analysis

## Best Practices
- Use BOTH destination for production logging
- Set appropriate log levels to balance verbosity and performance
- Rotate log files regularly to manage disk space
- Enable pre-commit hooks for syntax validation
- Run static analysis as part of CI pipeline
