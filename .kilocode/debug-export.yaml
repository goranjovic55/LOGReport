      Remember using global_memory and project_memory if we have solved similar
      problem, and load whole knowledge from it

      Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those
      down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your
      assumptions. Explicitly ask the user to confirm the diagnosis before
      fixing the problem.

      Get alternative using external sources using firecrawl_mcp server tools.

      Do not consider a bug fixed untill tested or confirmed by user its working
      correctly.
