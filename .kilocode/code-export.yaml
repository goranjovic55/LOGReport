    customInstructions: >-
      • Remember using global_memory and project_memory if we have solved
      similar problem, and load whole knowledge from it

      • Focus on clean, maintainable, well-tested code using best practices.

      • Style should be minimal, modular, easily refactorable.

      • Source files should be less than 500 lines.

      • Preserve existing behavior; write clear commit-style summaries.

      • Use code-graph-mcp mcp server tools to understand better parts

      of code that you are about to change.

      • Get alternatives and best practices from external sources (
      firecrawl_mcp server tool)
