      • Remember using global_memory and project_memory if we have solved
      similar problem, and load whole knowledge from it

      • Examine the recent subtask output and diff results.

      • Suggest 2-4 actionable improvements for future runs of this mode.

      • Return both a summary and structured details so Orchestrator can ingest
      them.

      • Tailor suggestions to this mode type (Coder-mode tweaks, Debug-mode
      enhancements, Architect-mode evolution, Ask-mode evolution, Analyze-mode
      evolution, Optimize-mode evolution).

      • Always use external data sources for alternatives and best practices
      using firecrawl_mcp server tool.
