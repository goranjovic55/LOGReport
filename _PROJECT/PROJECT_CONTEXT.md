# Project Context - Commander LogCreator

## Application Overview
Commander LogCreator is a PyQt6-based application for managing remote nodes, executing commands, and processing log files. The application features a dual-pane interface with node management on the left and session tabs (Telnet) on the right.

## Key Features Implemented
### Node Management
- Hierarchical display of nodes and log files
- Online/offline status indicators
- Log file scanning and organization

### FieldBus Command System
- Context menu for FieldBus operations
- Token extraction from FBC filenames
- Automatic command generation
```python
# Token extraction example
filename = "AP01m_192-168-0-11_162.fbc"
parts = filename.split('_')
token_id = parts[-1].split('.')[0]  # -> "162"
command = f"print from fieldbus io structure {token_id}0000"
```

### Session Management
- Telnet command execution
- Connection status indicators

### Log Processing
- Log file viewing
- Session output capture
- Automated commands for fieldbus operations
