# MODMeta Code Standards

## Overview

This directory contains the coding standards, best practices, and guidelines for the MODMeta project. The centerpiece of our standards system is the Log-Sum-Rule (LSR) methodology, which establishes a systematic process for continuous improvement based on empirical evidence.

## Log-Sum-Rule (LSR) Framework

The LSR framework is a data-driven approach to standardizing and improving development practices:

1. **Log** - Systematically capture detailed performance metrics and observations during development
2. **Sum** - Analyze and consolidate logged data to identify patterns and insights
3. **Rule** - Create actionable standards based on empirical evidence

This cycle ensures that our coding standards continuously evolve based on real-world experience rather than theoretical assumptions.

## Using the LSR Framework

### 1. Development Logging

Developers should create logs for significant development tasks using the provided templates. Logs capture:

- Time estimations vs. actuals
- Implementation approaches and alternatives
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Code metrics and quality assessments
- Key learnings and insights

Logs are stored in component-specific directories and linked to task IDs.

### 2. Summary Analysis

Periodically (weekly, monthly, quarterly), logs are analyzed to produce summaries that identify:

- Common patterns and anti-patterns
- Estimation accuracy trends
- Recurring obstacles and their resolutions
- Knowledge gaps and learning opportunities
- Efficiency opportunities

These summaries provide the empirical foundation for rule creation.

### 3. Rule Formulation

Rules are created based on patterns identified in summaries, following these guidelines:

- Each rule must be traceable to supporting evidence from summaries
- Rules should be classified as Hard Rules, Guidelines, or Patterns
- Rules require peer review and formal approval
- Each rule includes enforcement mechanisms and compliance metrics
- Rules are periodically reviewed for continued relevance

## Getting Started

1. Familiarize yourself with the [LSR methodology](LSR_STANDARD.md)
2. Review the templates in the LSR_TEMPLATES directory
3. Examine the examples in the LSR_EXAMPLES directory to understand the workflow
4. Start logging your development activities using the provided templates

## Rule Compliance

All code contributions to the MODMeta project must adhere to the rules in the RULES directory. Compliance is verified through:

- Automated static analysis tools
- Code review checklists
- Pre-commit hooks
- Continuous integration checks

Exceptions to rules must follow the exception process documented in each rule.

## Contributing to Standards

The standards system itself evolves based on project needs:

1. Create a development log describing issues with existing standards
2. Propose changes through the standard pull request process
3. Include supporting evidence for why changes are needed
4. Obtain approval from the architecture team
