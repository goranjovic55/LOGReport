## Recommendations

### Process Improvements

1. **Standardized Performance Benchmarking**
   - **Rationale:** Performance improvements are currently measured inconsistently
   - **Implementation Steps:**
     1. Define standard benchmark datasets
     2. Create automated benchmark tool
     3. Integrate with CI pipeline to track performance trends
   - **Expected Benefits:** Objective measurement of performance improvements, early detection of regressions
   - **Metrics to Track:** Scan time, memory usage, thread utilization

2. **Regular Technical Debt Reduction**
   - **Rationale:** Technical debt in core scanning logic is accumulating
   - **Implementation Steps:**
     1. Dedicate 10% of sprint capacity to debt reduction
     2. Maintain prioritized technical debt backlog
     3. Schedule refactoring for areas with highest debt
   - **Expected Benefits:** Improved maintainability, reduced bug rate
   - **Metrics to Track:** Cyclomatic complexity, defect density, maintainability index

### Technical Improvements

1. **File System Abstraction Layer**
   - **Rationale:** Platform-specific code is scattered throughout the Scanner component
   - **Implementation Steps:**
     1. Design File System Provider interface
     2. Implement platform-specific providers
     3. Refactor existing code to use the abstraction
   - **Expected Benefits:** Better testability, cleaner code, easier cross-platform support
   - **Metrics to Track:** Platform-specific bug count, code duplication

2. **Unified Configuration System**
   - **Rationale:** Configuration parameters are growing without structure
   - **Implementation Steps:**
     1. Design hierarchical configuration model
     2. Implement validation and documentation generation
     3. Migrate existing parameters to new system
   - **Expected Benefits:** Improved user experience, better documentation, parameter validation
   - **Metrics to Track:** Configuration-related support requests, documentation completeness

### Potential Rule Candidates

1. **Thread Safety Documentation Rule**
   - **Type:** Hard Rule
   - **Scope:** System-wide
   - **Description:** All classes that operate in multi-threaded contexts must document their thread safety characteristics
   - **Supporting Evidence:** 5 bugs related to unclear thread safety assumptions
   - **Expected Impact:** Fewer concurrency bugs, clearer APIs

2. **Batch Processing Pattern**
   - **Type:** Pattern
   - **Scope:** System-wide
   - **Description:** Operations on large datasets must implement batch processing with progress reporting
   - **Supporting Evidence:** 68% performance improvement in Scanner, similar improvements in Parser
