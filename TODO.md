# TODO List

This file contains a list of pending tasks and improvements for the LOGReport project.

## Project Management Tasks
- [ ] Editor Configuration: Configure VS Code with recommended extensions and settings for Python/Qt development, establish consistent code formatting rules (black, flake8, etc.)
- [ ] Linting/Static Analysis: Implement automated linting with pylint/flake8, set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks, add type hints throughout codebase
- [ ] Developer Awareness/Code Review: Create code review checklist focusing on Pythonic syntax and idioms, document common debugging patterns and anti-patterns, establish naming convention guidelines
- [ ] Initial Setup & Environment Configuration: Document development environment setup requirements, create automated setup script for new developers, verify all dependencies are properly versioned
- [ ] Code Structure & Design Patterns: Review and document current architecture patterns, identify opportunities for better separation of concerns, standardize module organization and imports
- [ ] Debugging Techniques & Tools: Implement configurable logging levels, add debug logging for critical workflows, document debugging workflow and tools
- [ ] Testing Practices: Expand unit test coverage for file I/O operations, add integration tests for critical paths, implement test data generation utilities
- [ ] Version Control Enhancements: Document git workflow best practices, create commit message guidelines, set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Architectural Improvements: Define explicit interfaces for services using Python ABCs, group related entities into dedicated modules, implement pre-development architectural planning phase, add comprehensive automated testing for interfaces
- [ ] Code Optimization Opportunities: Standardize NodeToken attribute names (node_name → name, node_ip → ip_address), implement static analysis for data model validation, add comprehensive type hinting for NodeToken class, create automated unit tests for NodeToken attribute changes, enhance code review guidelines for data model changes, enforce API contracts and type hinting across all modules, strengthen testing practices for network operations, implement robust input validation and error handling, enhance connection stability and logging for Telnet operations, consolidate Log Writing Logic in commander_window.py, improve `current_token` Handling in commander_window.py, centralize Status Message Emitting in commander_window.py, add Error Handling for Missing Node Definitions in commander_window.py, convert Path Operations to use `pathlib` in commander_window.py, add Type Hinting and Docstrings in commander_window.py, implement service layer abstraction for command services, consolidate duplicate signals across services, enhance token resolution error handling, standardize logging format across services, optimize command queue processing
- [x] Memory Consolidation Tasks: Verify all entity relationships in memory graph, document cross-entity relationships, review naming consistency across modules, document service layer patterns in memory graph
- [x] Exception Handling: Implement exception chaining for command execution errors to preserve original error context, enhance error handling in command queue processing
- [x] Logging: Standardize error logging format across services with consistent message structure and severity levels, implement structured logging for command execution
- [x] Exception Handling Refactoring: Implement exception chaining for command execution errors to preserve original error context, add detailed error context for network operations
- [x] Logging Standardization: Standardize error logging format across services with consistent message structure and severity levels, add command execution tracing
## Optimization Backlog

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement adaptive queue sizing based on historical load patterns
- [ ] Add command prioritization system (critical/normal/low)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for failed nodes
- [ ] Add command execution timeout handling

### Low Priority
- [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup in CommandWorker.run() using context managers or finally blocks, ensure proper telnet client lifecycle management
- [ ] Add queue state metrics collection for monitoring
- [x] Update memory management documentation to reflect MCP server usage for project and global memory
- [x] Document the use of document_user identity for consistent memory operations in documentation mode
- [x] Add sequential reasoning planning to documentation workflow using sequential_thinking MCP server
- [x] Incorporate external validation using firecrawl_mcp MCP server for documentation quality
- [x] Update memory loading, tracking, and persistence steps to use MCP server tools
- [x] Finalize memory updates with proper session closure and traceability
- [x] Fix batch token processing in context menus by replacing hardcoded command generation with service method calls
- [x] Document architectural pattern for service layer usage in batch operations, including why service layer is critical and how to identify similar issues
- [x] Create/update documentation in .docs/ about context menu implementation patterns
- [x] Update README.md about proper service layer usage for batch operations
- [x] Fix command queue re-execution issue by modifying start_processing() to only process pending commands and implementing queue cleanup in _handle_worker_finished() to remove completed commands
- [x] Fix log file initialization for context menu actions by ensuring command queue properly passes token information with completion signals and commander window handles command completion with token information

## Memory Architecture Tasks
- [x] Implement dual-assertion model with project_memory and global_memory MCP servers
- [x] Add UAL (Universal Asset Locator) identifier system for cross-context asset referencing
- [x] Integrate cryptographic verification process with SHA-256 hashing for memory integrity
- [x] Add versioned memory schema with state chaining for consistency validation
- [x] Implement validation checkpoint for memory operations
- [x] Document memory consolidation workflow in architecture documentation
