# TODO List

This file contains a list of pending tasks and improvements for the LOGReport project.

## Project Management Tasks
- [ ] Editor Configuration: Configure VS Code with recommended extensions and settings for Python/Qt development, establish consistent code formatting rules (black, flake8, etc.)
- [ ] Linting/Static Analysis: Implement automated linting with pylint/flake8, set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks, add type hints throughout codebase
- [ ] Developer Awareness/Code Review: Create code review checklist focusing on Pythonic syntax and idioms, document common debugging patterns and anti-patterns, establish naming convention guidelines
- [ ] Initial Setup & Environment Configuration: Document development environment setup requirements, create automated setup script for new developers, verify all dependencies are properly versioned
- [ ] Code Structure & Design Patterns: Review and document current architecture patterns, identify opportunities for better separation of concerns, standardize module organization and imports
- [ ] Debugging Techniques & Tools: Implement configurable logging levels, add debug logging for critical workflows, document debugging workflow and tools
- [ ] Testing Practices: Expand unit test coverage for file I/O operations, add integration tests for critical paths, implement test data generation utilities
- [ ] Version Control Enhancements: Document git workflow best practices, create commit message guidelines, set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Architectural Improvements: Define explicit interfaces for services using Python ABCs, group related entities into dedicated modules, implement pre-development architectural planning phase, add comprehensive automated testing for interfaces
- [ ] Code Optimization Opportunities: Standardize NodeToken attribute names (node_name → name, node_ip → ip_address), implement static analysis for data model validation, add comprehensive type hinting for NodeToken class, create automated unit tests for NodeToken attribute changes, enhance code review guidelines for data model changes, enforce API contracts and type hinting across all modules, strengthen testing practices for network operations, implement robust input validation and error handling, enhance connection stability and logging for Telnet operations, consolidate Log Writing Logic in commander_window.py, improve `current_token` Handling in commander_window.py, centralize Status Message Emitting in commander_window.py, add Error Handling for Missing Node Definitions in commander_window.py, convert Path Operations to use `pathlib` in commander_window.py, add Type Hinting and Docstrings in commander_window.py
- [ ] Memory Consolidation Tasks: Verify all entity relationships in memory graph, document cross-entity relationships, review naming consistency across modules
- [ ] Update memory management documentation to reflect MCP server usage for project and global memory
- [ ] Document the use of document_user identity for consistent memory operations in documentation mode
- [ ] Add sequential reasoning planning to documentation workflow using sequential_thinking MCP server
- [ ] Incorporate external validation using firecrawl_mcp MCP server for documentation quality
- [ ] Update memory loading, tracking, and persistence steps to use MCP server tools
- [ ] Finalize memory updates with proper session closure and traceability
- [x] Fix batch token processing in context menus by replacing hardcoded command generation with service method calls
- [x] Document architectural pattern for service layer usage in batch operations, including why service layer is critical and how to identify similar issues
- [x] Create/update documentation in .docs/ about context menu implementation patterns
- [x] Update README.md about proper service layer usage for batch operations
- [x] Fix command queue re-execution issue by modifying start_processing() to only process pending commands and implementing queue cleanup in _handle_worker_finished() to remove completed commands
- [x] Fix log file initialization for context menu actions by ensuring command queue properly passes token information with completion signals and commander window handles command completion with token information
