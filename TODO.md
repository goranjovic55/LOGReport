- [ ] Enhance connection stability and logging for Telnet operations
- [ ] Consolidate Log Writing Logic in commander_window.py
- [ ] Improve `current_token` Handling in commander_window.py
- [ ] Centralize Status Message Emitting in commander_window.py
- [ ] Add Error Handling for Missing Node Definitions in commander_window.py
- [ ] Convert Path Operations to use `pathlib` in commander_window.py
- [x] Add Type Hinting and Docstrings in commander_window.py

## Memory Consolidation Tasks
- [ ] Verify all entity relationships in memory graph
- [ ] Document cross-entity relationships
- [ ] Review naming consistency across modules

## Optimization Suggestions
- [ ] Implement asynchronous batch processing for command handling to improve performance
- [ ] Optimize logging pipeline for better throughput and reduced latency
- [ ] Introduce connection pooling to manage network resources efficiently
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for enhanced robustness in network communication
- [ ] Enhance Unicode handling in logging with backslashreplace fallback strategy
- [ ] Enforce command timeout with dual-layer approach for reliability
- [ ] Develop a unified command interface using BaseCommandService abstract base class
- [ ] Centralize error handling with a CommandError hierarchy for maintainability
- [ ] Expand type hinting coverage across command processing modules
- [ ] Set connection resource limits to prevent exhaustion
- [ ] Utilize memory-mapped logging for efficient file I/O
- [ ] Tune thread pool parameters for optimal resource usage
