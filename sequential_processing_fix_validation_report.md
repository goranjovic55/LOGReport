# FBC Token Detection Fix Validation Report

## Issue Summary
The FBC token detection was not working correctly for .log files. Only 1 token (162) was being detected instead of the expected 3 tokens (162, 163, 164) for node AP01m. The root cause was that .log files were incorrectly classified as LOG type instead of FBC/RPC based on their filename content.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `NodeManager.scan_log_files` method in `src/commander/node_manager.py`. When processing .log files, the method was automatically classifying them as "LOG" type without checking the filename pattern. This meant that files like "162_FBC.log", "163_FBC.log", and "164_FBC.log" were all being treated as LOG files instead of their respective FBC, FBC, and RPC types.

## Fix Implementation

### Changes Made
1. **Modified token type detection for .log files**: Updated the logic to extract token type from the filename pattern for .log files
2. **Improved node name extraction**: Enhanced the logic to use directory name for node-specific files
3. **Updated token ID extraction**: Modified the token ID extraction to handle the new filename pattern correctly

### Code Changes
The key changes were made in the `scan_log_files` method in `src/commander/node_manager.py`:

```python
# Handle LOG files by filename pattern
if filename.lower().endswith('.log'):
    # Extract token type from filename for .log files
    parts = base_name.split('_')
    if len(parts) >= 2 and parts[-1].upper() in token_types:
        # Pattern: XXX_FBC.log, XXX_RPC.log, etc.
        token_type_dir = parts[-1].upper()
        # For node-specific files in node directories, use directory name as node_name
        dir_basename = os.path.basename(dirpath)
        if dir_basename in [n.name for n in self.nodes.values()]:
            node_name = dir_basename
        else:
            # Fallback to first part of filename as node name
            node_name = parts[0] if parts else "UNKNOWN"
    else:
        # Default to LOG type for files that don't match the pattern
        token_type_dir = "LOG"
        # For node-specific files in node directories, use directory name as node_name
        dir_basename = os.path.basename(dirpath)
        if dir_basename in [n.name for n in self.nodes.values()]:
            node_name = dir_basename
        else:
            # Fallback to first part of filename as node name
            node_name = parts[0] if parts else "UNKNOWN"
    print(f"[DEBUG] LOG file detected: node_name={node_name}, token_type={token_type_dir}")
```

And the token ID extraction was updated to:
```python
# Extract token ID from filename (last alphanumeric part)
parts = base_name.split('_')
token_id_candidate = parts[-2] if len(parts) >= 2 and parts[-1].upper() in token_types else (parts[-1] if parts else None)
```

## Validation Results

### Test Execution
A comprehensive test was created (`test_simple_fbc_fix.py`) to validate the fix:

```
=== FBC Token Detection Results ===
Token 162 log path: C:\Users\GORJOV~1\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpglo3dx7k\AP01m\162_FBC.log
Token 163 log path: C:\Users\GORJOV~1\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpglo3dx7k\AP01m\163_FBC.log
Token 164 log path: C:\Users\GORJOV~1\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpglo3dx7k\AP01m\164_FBC.log
âœ“ Token 162 correctly mapped to 162_FBC.log
âœ“ Token 163 correctly mapped to 163_FBC.log
âœ“ Token 164 correctly mapped to 164_FBC.log

=== Token Type Classification Verification ===
âœ“ Files with _FBC.log pattern are correctly classified as FBC type
âœ“ Files with _RPC.log pattern are correctly classified as RPC type
âœ“ Files with _LOG.log pattern are correctly classified as LOG type
âœ“ Node name is extracted from directory name for node-specific files

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! FBC token detection fix is working correctly.
```

### Debug Output Verification
From the debug output, we can see that the fix is working correctly:

1. `162_FBC.log` is correctly classified as FBC type:
   `[DEBUG] LOG file detected: node_name=AP01m, token_type=FBC`

2. `163_FBC.log` is correctly classified as FBC type:
   `[DEBUG] LOG file detected: node_name=AP01m, token_type=FBC`

3. `164_FBC.log` is correctly classified as FBC type:
   `[DEBUG] LOG file detected: node_name=AP01m, token_type=FBC`

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
1. **Correct token detection**: All FBC tokens (162, 163, 164) are now correctly detected for node AP01m
2. **Improved file classification**: .log files are now correctly classified based on their filename patterns
3. **Better node name extraction**: Node names are correctly extracted from directory names for node-specific files
4. **Maintained compatibility**: Existing LOG file processing continues to work as expected

### Constraints Maintained
1. **Token normalization**: 3-digit format normalization is maintained
2. **Context menu filtering**: Existing filtering rules are preserved
3. **Log file naming conventions**: Works with existing conventions (e.g., 162_FBC.log)
4. **Backward compatibility**: Existing LOG file processing is not broken

## Conclusion
The fix successfully resolves the FBC token detection issue. All three expected tokens (162, 163, 164) are now correctly detected for node AP01m. The implementation maintains all existing constraints while improving the accuracy of token type detection from .log filenames.
