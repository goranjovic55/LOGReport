# Orchestrator Simulation: update_memory.md Workflow Execution

## Input: User Request
"Execute the memory optimization workflow to clean up and condense our project memory"

---

## Layer 1: custom_modes.yaml Processing

**Mode Selected**: `mcp-orchestrator` (triggered by complex multi-step workflow)

**IDENTITY**: Specialized MCP orchestrator managing task delegation across multiple AI agents with integrated memory optimization capabilities.

**CORE_RESTRICTIONS** (Executed First):
1. ✅ Check available MCP servers: `project_memory`, `global_memory`, `meta-mind`, `mcp-code-graph`, `sequential_thinking`, `deepwiki`, `firecrawl_mcp`
2. ✅ Use appropriate tools to gather context and execute tasks
3. ✅ Document tool usage and results in response
4. ✅ If no relevant tools exist, explain what tools would be needed

**OPTIMIZE** (Core Instructions):
1. ✅ Break complex requests into specialized tasks for appropriate MCP modes
2. ✅ Delegate to mcp-architect, mcp-analyze, mcp-code, mcp-debug, or mcp-test based on task type
3. ✅ Monitor progress and integrate results into cohesive solutions
4. ✅ Maintain memory connectivity and optimize entity relationships during delegation

## Layer 2: mcp_contract.md Server Mapping

**MANDATORY Pre-Execution Protocol** (From update_memory.md):
- ✅ Check available MCP servers for memory and task management capabilities
- ✅ Use appropriate server tools for execution
- ✅ Document tool usage and results
- ✅ NEVER reason internally when servers exist

**Server Mapping for Memory Workflow**:
- **Graph Analysis**: `project_memory` server → `search_nodes`, `read_graph`
- **Memory Search**: `project_memory`, `global_memory` servers → `search_nodes`
- **Planning**: `meta-mind` server → `request_planning`, `add_tasks_to_request`
- **Entity Management**: `project_memory`, `global_memory` servers → `create_entities`, `delete_entities`
- **Task Completion**: `meta-mind` server → `mark_task_done`, `log_task_completion_summary`

## Analysis: Why This Works

1. **3-Layer Separation**: Each layer has clear responsibility - commands→mapping→execution
2. **Universal Protocol**: CORE_RESTRICTIONS ensure MCP compliance at every step
3. **Intelligent Delegation**: Orchestrator correctly routes memory tasks to appropriate specialists
4. **Tool Precision**: Every operation maps to verified MCP server capabilities
5. **Checkpoint Resiliency**: meta-mind tracking enables recovery from any interruption
6. **Circular Learning**: Results feed back into memory system for continuous improvement

The simulation demonstrates our 3-layer system successfully transforms a complex workflow into systematic, trackable, MCP-compliant execution with intelligent specialist coordination.
