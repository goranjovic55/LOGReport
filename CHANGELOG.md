# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- [FIX] Node resolution: Corrected IP address resolution for hybrid FBC/RPC tokens by implementing fallback logic in [`RpcCommandService.get_token()`](src/commander/services/rpc_command_service.py:58) that allows FBC tokens to be used for RPC commands when no RPC token exists
- [FEATURE] Dynamic IP extraction from log filenames by scanning directory and file names for IP patterns (e.g., 192-168-0-11) in [`NodeManager._scan_for_dynamic_ips()`](src/commander/node_manager.py:396) and updating token IP addresses accordingly
- [IMPROVEMENT] Enhanced token type handling with fallback logic and improved validation in [`LogWriter.open_log()`](src/commander/log_writer.py:55) that validates token IP addresses against filename IPs and provides warnings for mismatches
- Fixed log file initialization for context menu actions by ensuring command queue properly passes token information with completion signals and commander window handles command completion with token information
- Fixed command queue re-execution issue where completed commands remained in the queue and were executed again when new commands were added. The fix modifies `CommandQueue.start_processing()` to only process pending commands and implements queue cleanup in `CommandQueue._handle_worker_finished()` to remove completed commands from the queue. This prevents previous commands (e.g., token 162) from re-executing when new commands (e.g., token 182) are triggered.
- Updated memory management workflow documentation in `.docs/memory_management.md` to reflect the improved dual memory consolidation process using `project_memory` and `global_memory` MCP servers.
- Enhanced README.md with a high-level overview of the memory consolidation process, detailing how the system uses dual memory for project-specific and cross-project knowledge.
- Updated documentation workflow to follow the MCP-aligned, command-safe pattern with consistent identity scoping using `document_user`.
- Added sequential reasoning planning using the `sequential_thinking` MCP server for structured documentation updates.
- Incorporated external validation using the `firecrawl_mcp` MCP server to ensure documentation aligns with community standards.
- Updated memory loading, tracking, and persistence steps to use MCP server tools for both project and global memory.
- Finalized memory updates with proper session closure and traceability under the `document_user` identity.
- Implemented context menu filtering system to control command visibility based on node type and section. The `ContextMenuFilterService` now manages filtering rules from configuration, allowing for flexible control of context menu items without code changes.
- Removed AP01m command from FBC subclass group context menus through configuration-driven filtering. This optimization reduces clutter and prevents execution of deprecated commands on specific node types.
- Documented the existing functionality for right-click actions on FBC and RPC group nodes in the README.md. This includes the use of `CommanderWindow.process_all_fbc_subgroup_commands` and `process_all_rpc_subgroup_commands` methods, which utilize `NodeManager` to get child log files and `CommandQueue` to dispatch commands with error handling and sequential processing.
- Fixed issue where commands from `.fbc` log files were not displayed in the Telnet terminal. The fix involved removing an explicit `command_queue.start_processing()` call in [`FbcCommandService.queue_fieldbus_command()`](src/commander/services/fbc_command_service.py:53). This change ensures that FBC commands now follow the same processing flow as RPC commands, resulting in their outputs being correctly displayed in the terminal.
- Resolved `UnicodeEncodeError` in logging by configuring log file writing to use UTF-8 encoding, enabling proper handling of Unicode characters such as emojis (e.g., 'üìù').
- Consolidated Telnet operations and command services into standardized patterns, promoting reusable components to global memory.
- Implemented the NetworkSession base class for standardized network operations.
- Standardized error handling with global error codes.
- Optimized the memory graph with a hierarchical service taxonomy.
- Fixed batch token processing in context menus by replacing hardcoded command generation with service method calls in `process_all_fbc_subgroup_commands()` and `process_all_rpc_subgroup_commands()`. This ensures all tokens in a batch are properly processed rather than just the first one.
- Enhanced CHANGELOG.md with detailed technical explanation of the batch token processing fix, including the architectural rationale for using service layer methods instead of direct command queue manipulation. The fix involved modifying `process_all_fbc_subgroup_commands()` to use `fbc_service.queue_fieldbus_command()` and `process_all_rpc_subgroup_commands()` to use `rpc_service.queue_rpc_command()`, which ensures proper command generation, error handling, and logging. This change maintains the batch processing loop structure while leveraging the service layer's capabilities, and removes the need for manual `command_queue.start_processing()` calls since service methods handle that internally.
