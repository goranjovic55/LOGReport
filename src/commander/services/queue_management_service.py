Queue Management Service
This service manages the command queue and provides progress tracking and completion signals.
It handles the execution of commands in a thread-safe manner and manages the command processing lifecycle.

## Responsibilities

The QueueManagementService is responsible for:
- Managing the command execution queue with thread-safe operations
- Tracking command processing state and progress
- Coordinating between command services and the command queue
- Ensuring proper command execution order and resource management
- Providing completion signals and error reporting
- Handling connection management for command execution
- Implementing retry mechanisms for failed commands
- Maintaining command history and execution logs

## Integration Pattern

The service follows a delegation pattern where:
1. Command services (FbcCommandService, RpcCommandService) add commands to the queue
2. QueueManagementService processes commands in worker threads
3. Results are reported back through signals to the UI layer
4. Error handling and logging are centralized in the service layer

## Key Features

- Thread-safe command queue with atomic operations
- Progress tracking with completion percentage
- Automatic connection management and reconnection
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- Error handling with detailed diagnostics
- Command status tracking (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Resource cleanup and session management
- Support for both manual and automatic command execution
