# üî• BRUTAL HONEST ANALYSIS: Custom Modes

## **OVERALL ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT: B-**

### **üéØ WHAT WORKS WELL**

#### **‚úÖ ORCHESTRATOR MODE** - Grade: **A-**
**Strengths:**
- Clear delegation-only mandate (never implements directly)
- Excellent template structure for delegation
- Proper checkpoint management with resumable workflows
- Good mode selection guidance

**Minor Issues:**
- MANDATORY ACTIONS vs WORKFLOW steps mismatch (LOAD vs REMEMBER)
- 6-step process conflicts with "5-step process" mentioned earlier

#### **‚úÖ ARCHITECT MODE** - Grade: **B+**
**Strengths:**
- Clear boundary: design only, no implementation
- Good strategic focus on patterns and roadmaps
- Proper handoff structure

**Issues:**
- Missing THINK action in MANDATORY ACTIONS (needed for design decisions)
- Only 3 MANDATORY ACTIONS vs 4 for other modes (inconsistent)

#### **‚úÖ DEBUG MODE** - Grade: **B+**
**Strengths:**
- Excellent hands-on approach with runtime observation
- Good user confirmation requirement for permanent changes
- Proper systematic hypothesis testing

**Issues:**
- MANDATORY ACTIONS order questionable (LOAD should be first, not third)

### **üî• CRITICAL PROBLEMS**

#### **‚ùå ANALYZE MODE** - Grade: **C-**
**MAJOR FLAWS:**
- **Broken MANDATORY ACTIONS order**: ANALYZE first, LOAD third makes no sense
- **Missing PLAN action**: How can you analyze without systematic planning?
- **4-step workflow vs 5-step claim**: Says "5-step process" but shows 4 steps
- **Redundancy**: DISCOVER in both MANDATORY ACTIONS and workflow step

#### **‚ùå TEST MODE** - Grade: **D+**
**CRITICAL FAILURES:**
- **Only 3 MANDATORY ACTIONS**: Inconsistent with other modes
- **Missing PLAN action**: Testing without planning is chaos
- **No THINK action**: Complex validation decisions need systematic reasoning
- **Weak validation capability**: "Can test functionality" but no actual test execution tools defined

#### **‚ùå CODE MODE** - Grade: **C**
**PROBLEMS:**
- **ANALYZE first**: Should LOAD context before analyzing
- **Missing THINK action**: Implementation decisions need step-by-step reasoning
- **Workflow mismatch**: Says REMEMBER‚ÜíASSESS but MANDATORY ACTIONS don't align

---

### **üö® CONSISTENCY FAILURES**

#### **MANDATORY ACTIONS Inconsistency:**
- **ORCHESTRATOR**: 4 actions (LOAD, PLAN, THINK, RESEARCH) ‚úÖ
- **ARCHITECT**: 3 actions (LOAD, PLAN, RESEARCH) ‚ùå Missing THINK
- **ANALYZE**: 4 actions but wrong order ‚ùå 
- **DEBUG**: 4 actions but wrong order ‚ùå
- **TEST**: 3 actions ‚ùå Missing PLAN and THINK
- **CODE**: 4 actions but wrong order ‚ùå

#### **Workflow Step Count Inconsistency:**
- **ORCHESTRATOR**: Claims 5-step but shows 6 steps ‚ùå
- **ARCHITECT**: Claims 5-step, shows 5 steps ‚úÖ
- **ANALYZE**: Claims 5-step, shows 5 steps ‚úÖ
- **DEBUG**: Claims 5-step, shows 5 steps ‚úÖ
- **TEST**: Claims 5-step, shows 5 steps ‚úÖ
- **CODE**: Claims 5-step, shows 5 steps ‚úÖ

### **üí° OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS**

#### **IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:**

1. **Standardize MANDATORY ACTIONS** (All should have same 4 actions in logical order):
   ```yaml
   - LOAD: Retrieve context from memory
   - PLAN: Create systematic strategy
   - THINK: Apply step-by-step reasoning
   - RESEARCH: Investigate external sources when needed
   ```

2. **Fix ORCHESTRATOR step count**: Either 5 or 6, not both

3. **Fix ANALYZE mode**: Completely broken action order and missing PLAN

4. **Fix TEST mode**: Add missing PLAN and THINK actions

5. **Fix CODE mode**: LOAD should come before ANALYZE

#### **DESIGN PRINCIPLE VIOLATIONS:**

- **Inconsistent cognitive load**: Different action counts confuse LLMs
- **Illogical action ordering**: ANALYZE before LOAD makes no sense
- **Missing systematic reasoning**: TEST and ARCHITECT missing THINK action
- **Workflow-action misalignment**: REMEMBER in workflow but LOAD in actions

---

### **üèÜ RECOMMENDATIONS**

#### **STANDARDIZE IMMEDIATELY:**
1. **All modes get identical MANDATORY ACTIONS structure**
2. **Fix action ordering logic**: LOAD ‚Üí PLAN ‚Üí THINK ‚Üí RESEARCH
3. **Consistent step counting**: Pick 5 or 6 and stick to it
4. **Align workflow terms**: Either all use LOAD or all use REMEMBER

#### **GRADE BY PRIORITY TO FIX:**
1. **ANALYZE mode**: Complete overhaul needed (worst offender)
2. **TEST mode**: Missing critical actions
3. **CODE mode**: Action order fix
4. **ORCHESTRATOR**: Step count consistency
5. **ARCHITECT**: Add THINK action
6. **DEBUG**: Action order fix

**BRUTAL VERDICT**: Good concept, inconsistent execution. Needs standardization pass to achieve enterprise readiness.
